# Forest Fire Prediction


This repository contains the source code and methodology of a machine learning project developed as part of my master's thesis. The aim of this study is to predict forest fires based on environmental variables.

## üìå Thesis Information

- **Thesis Title**: Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms: A Simulation-Based Study and an Application on Forest Fire Data
- **University**: Gazi University

## üîç Project Overview

This project uses real environmental data to train classification models that predict whether a forest fire will occur. The process includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Evaluation using performance metrics
